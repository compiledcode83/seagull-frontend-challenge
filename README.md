# Frontend Challenge Using NextJS for React

Please note that this is a simple challenge meant to indicate simple technical grasp and is not intended to be a full-fledged assessment. While NextJS is used, you are not expected to use any of its selling-point features such as server-side rendering, SSR, or code-splitting. A simple use of the `fetch` impmentation and classical react hooks is all we need you to use.

## Contents

- [Frontend app](app-frontend) - a React app. This is where you will be implementing your code.
- [E2E test suites](cypress/integration) - a frontend Cypress test suite. You may want to read the tests included to better understand the desired behavior your code should exhibit.
- [Pipeline](.github/workflows/tests.yml) - a test Runner that executes the Cypress tests on push to a branch other than `master`/`main`. You do not need to access nor change this file.

## Tech Stack
